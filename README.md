# 🧠 Sensora

A multisensory interface to help blind and visually impaired individuals perceive their environment through AI, sound, and touch.

## 📌 Project Overview

Sensora is an innovative system designed to improve the autonomy of blind people by combining:

- smart glasses capable of analyzing the environment via AI,
- and a haptic glove with dynamic braille that transmits information through pressure.

Today, existing solutions are mainly limited to connected glasses and make very little use of the sense of touch, which is essential for visually impaired people.

Sensora offers a new approach: transforming visual information into tactile and auditory feedback, in an intuitive and natural way.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Develop a new and complete sensory system to transmit information.
- Leverage touch through a haptic glove that can activate each braille point individually.
- Provide real-time environmental analysis using AI (objects, obstacles, texts).
- Offer smooth voice communication with the user.
- Test the device with blind users, supervised by experts.
- Design a functional prototype combining vision, audio, and haptics.
